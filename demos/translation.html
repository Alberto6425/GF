<H1>What you can expect</H1>

<P>
The program is designed to translate anything, just like Google translate and Bing. It has some advantages over them:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>It uses <B>grammars</B> (as opposed to statistics), which makes it more correct in many cases.
<LI>It is <B>open source</B>, which means you can inspect, copy, and modify it in what ever way you want.
<LI>It is <B>light weight</B>, so that you can run it on your own computer and even on a smartphone.
<LI>It gives you <B>linguistic information</B>, such as word inflections.
<LI>It gives you <B>confidence information</B>, warning about translations that it is not so sure about.
</UL>

<P>
However, this is not a mature product but a research prototype. It therefore has some shortcomings:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>It has <B>limited coverage</B>, which means that it misses many words and syntactic constructions.
<LI>It can be <B>clumsy</B>, for instance when it doesn't detect an idiom but translates too literally.
<LI>It can be <B>slow</B>, in particular with long sentences and with some input languages.
</UL>

<P>
Here are some hints to use it in a satisfactory way:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Start with short sentences (less than ten words), preferably from English or Swedish, to get an idea of the best performance.
<LI>Take a look at the alternative translations, in particular for sentences with low confidence level.
<LI>Send us feedback, and consider contributing to the improvement of the system!
</UL>
